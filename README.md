- Generate BED files from gene symbols, rsIDs, and genomic coordinates
- Support for both GRCh37 (hg19) and GRCh38 (hg38) genome assemblies
- Integration with PanelApp for importing gene lists from predefined panels
- Ability to add padding to gene regions
- Interactive results view with IGV (Integrative Genomics Viewer) integration
- Downloadable BED file output
